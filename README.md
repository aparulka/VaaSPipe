## What is VaaSPipe

VaaSPipe is a flexible module to extract datasets (KPIs, Dimensions) from VaaS customer systems.
It is written in Python3 and takes in 4 YAML arguments to chain the various components of each data pipeline:

- Service Configuration: service configuration and main parameters
- Transformation: defines rules to modify the output from API calls
- Notification: specify the details of the STMP server and a list of email addresses to send CSV (tab-separated) outputs attached to an email
- Data Source: specify the details of the source system. It supports nG1, nGP and nG1 Postgres data sources

## Building and Running VaaSPipe:

VaaSPipe is designed to be run inside a container with all required Python dependencies. The image is based off Alpine OS and as of this writting takes about 300MB.

The lastest production & development ready image can be fetched from http://vaas-git.labs.netscout.com/erodrigu/docker_images.git , VaaSPipe/Dockerfile
( http://172.20.237.165/erodrigu/docker_images/tree/master/VaaSPipe ).  Build your image/container by following the instructions in the corresponding README.md

One can also run VaaSPipe on any system with Python and these requirements installed:

```
/VaaSPipe # python3 -m pip list

## Developing for VaaSPipe:

If you want to merge any code into VaaSPipe, you'll need a pull request, or email eduardo.rodriguez@netscout.com.

The typical development workflow used in this project is this:
```
- Select a directory to host your development environment
- git init # setup git in development directory
- git clone http://vaas-git.labs.netscout.com/erodrigu/VaaSPipe.git # clone VaaSPipe
- git remote add origin http://vaas-git.labs.netscout.com/erodrigu/VaaSPipe.git # setup origin to simplify commands
- git fetch --all
- git reset --hard origin/master
- git checkout -b your-branch-name master
- git branch # ensure you're in the right branch
<< Work on your code and configuration changes >>
- git add -A :/ # stage changes
- git commit â€“a # commit changes locally.  Do not forget to add a commit message
- git push -u origin your-branch-name # push changes to GitLab server
```

After testing the feature and getting approval, you'll be ready to merge to master to produce a new release

```
- git checkout master
if you need to discard any local changes on that branch, issue
- git checkout master -f
- git pull origin master
- git merge first_updates
- git push origin master
```

## Resource utilization

To monitor VaaSPipe, use docker stats command.  Typically, VaaSPipe execution last a few seconds (<10 seconds) and use around 20MB of RAM. In idle state, the memory footprint of VaaSPipe is only 644KBytes.

```
docker stats vaaspipe
